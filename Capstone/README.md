	# Capstone Project
	## Crowdflower Search Results Relevance

	The goal of this project is to create a model that can be used to predict the forest cover type.

	### Install

	This project requires **Python 3.5** with the following library installed:
	- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
	- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
	- [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

	### Data

	The datasets can be found in the `/data` folder:
	`train.csv`
	`test.csv`

	They can also be downloaded from the [Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data).


	### Run

	In a terminal or command window, run the following command:

	```python main.py```  

	This will run the `main.py` file and execute the machine learning code.
